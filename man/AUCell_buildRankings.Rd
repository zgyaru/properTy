\arguments{
\item{exprMat}{Expression matrix (genes as rows, cells as columns)
The expression matrix can also be provided as one of the Bioconductor classes:
\itemize{
\item \link{RangedSummarizedExperiment} and derived classes (e.g. \link[SingleCellExperiment]{SingleCellExperiment} ):
The matrix will be obtained through assay(exprMatrix),
-which will extract the first assay (usually the counts)-
or the assay name given in 'assayName'
\item \link[Matrix]{dgCMatrix-class}:
Sparse matrix
\item \code{ExpressionSet}:
The matrix will be obtained through exprs(exprMatrix)
}}

\item{plotStats}{Should the function plot the expression boxplots/histograms?
(TRUE / FALSE). These plots can also be produced
with the function \code{\link{plotGeneCount}}.}

\item{nCores}{Number of cores to use for computation.}

\item{mctype}{Experimental feature (use at your own risk): Alternative methods to run the parallel compuations (e.g. through different packages)}

\item{keepZeroesAsNA}{Experimental feature (use at your own risk): convert zeroes to NA instead of locating randomly at the end of the ranking.}

\item{verbose}{Should the function show progress messages? (TRUE / FALSE)}

\item{...}{Other arguments}

\item{assayName}{Name of the assay containing the expression matrix (e.g. in \link[SingleCellExperiment]{SingleCellExperiment} objects)}
}
\value{
data.table of genes (row) by cells (columns)
with the ranking of the gene within the cell.
}
\description{
Builds the "rankings" for each cell:
expression-based ranking for all the genes in each cell.

The genes with same expression value are shuffled.
Therefore, genes with expression '0' are randomly sorted at the
end of the ranking.

These "rankings" can be seen as a new representation of the original dataset.
Once they are calculated, they can be saved for future analyses.
}
\details{
It is important to check that most cells have at least the number of
expressed/detected genes that are going to be used to calculate the AUC
(`aucMaxRank` in `calcAUC()`).
The histogram provided by `AUCell_buildRankings()`
allows to quickly check this distribution.
`plotGeneCount(exprMatrix)` allows to obtain only the plot before
building the rankings.
